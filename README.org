To enable Github Pages, you need to go to Repository -> Settings -> Pages -> Source -> set to gh-pages branch and / (root).

If gh-pages is not available in Source, just create and push a branch called gh-pages and it should be available.

If you renamed the main branch to something else (say you re-initialized the repository with master as the initial branch), be sure to edit the github workflows .github/workflows/pages.yml file to reflect the change.
